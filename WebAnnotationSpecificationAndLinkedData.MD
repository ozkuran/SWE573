## 1. Introduction <a id="1.introduction"></a>

Annotations are simply comments that helps differentiation between same type of objects. In the digital world from tags on the pictures that shared on the [Instagram] (https://www.instagram.com/) to mentions in a tweet there are many types of data annotations present. [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)] (https://www.w3.org/) took the initiative on standardizing the annotations on the web with [Web Annotation Specification] (https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/).

### 1.1 Web Annotation Specification <a id="1.1.webannotationspecification"></a>

Web Annotation specification provides a simple framework for sharing annotations among different platforms. As it provides option for giving simple text annotation on a single web page, it has also plenty options for creating rich annotations. In  Web annotation data model an annotation is a considered as set of connected resources -which are a `body` and a `target`- where information in the body is related the target. 

### 1.2 Linked Data <a id="1.2.linkeddata"></a>

Linked Data is heart of the [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) which can be described as collection of interrelated Data Sets on the web. Its purpose is to convert bilions of unrelated datasets into a world wide collection of data.

Linked Data is seen as the future of the web. [Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/) (Inventor of the World Wide Web) explains Linked Data as *"Like the web of hypertext, the web of data is constructed with documents on the web."* in his initial [document](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) dates back to 2006. He mentioned 4 concepts to be applied for Linked Data become reality. 

1. Use [URI](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt)s as names for things

2. Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.

3. When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards ([RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/), [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-overview-20130321/))

4. Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.

Those 4 rules listed above can be described as fundamental rules of the Linked Data. To Linked Data become useful in addition to this framework there are detailed requirements present. Detailed information about Linked Data might be found in W3C [website](https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-ldp-20150226/).
