## 1. Introduction <a id="1.introduction"></a>

Annotations are simply comments that helps differentiation between same type of objects. In the digital world from tags on the pictures that shared on the [Instagram] (https://www.instagram.com/) to mentions in a tweet there are many types of data annotations present. [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)] (https://www.w3.org/) took the initiative on standardizing the annotations on the web with [Web Annotation Specification] (https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/).

### 1.1 Web Annotation Specification <a id="1.1.webannotationspecification"></a>

Web Annotation specification provides a simple framework for sharing annotations among different platforms. As it provides option for giving simple text annotation on a single web page, it has also plenty options for creating rich annotations. In  Web annotation data model an annotation is a considered as set of connected resources -which are a `body` and a `target`- where information in the body is related the target. 

### 1.2 Linked Data <a id="1.2.linkeddata"></a>

Linked Data is heart of the [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) which can be described as collection of interrelated Data Sets on the web. Its purpose is to convert bilions of unrelated datasets into a world wide collection of data.

# 3. Linked Data <a id="3.linkeddata"></a>

Linked Data is seen as the future of the web. [Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/) (Inventor of the World Wide Web) explains Linked Data as *"Like the web of hypertext, the web of data is constructed with documents on the web."* in his initial [document](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) dates back to 2006.
